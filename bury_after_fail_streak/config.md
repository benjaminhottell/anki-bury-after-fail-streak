- `fail_on_hard` (boolean) - if `true`, then pressing Hard counts as a failure as far as the fail streak is concerned.
- `paused` (boolean) - if `true`, the plugin will not check for fail streaks (and thus not bury anything)
- `streak` (int) - the number of consecutive failures before the card is buried
