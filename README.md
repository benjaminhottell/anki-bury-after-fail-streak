# Bury After Fail Streak

This [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) addon will automatically bury cards that you have repeatedly failed. If you fail the same card 3 times consecutively on the same day, the card is buried. (Buried cards are disabled until the next day)

This will help limit the amount of suffering you have on bad days where a card just won't stick.


## Installation

Copy the `bury_after_fail_streak` folder to the `addons` directory.

My `addons` directory happens to be at `$HOME/.local/share/Anki2/addons21`.
