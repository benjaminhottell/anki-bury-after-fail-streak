# Bury After Fail Streak

This Anki plugin will help limit the amount of suffering you have on bad days where a card just won't stick. If you fail the same card 3 times consecutively on the same day, the card is buried. Try again tomorrow :)

A "fail" is defined as pressing 'hard' or 'again'. (No distinction is made between them)
